# ATS-Compliant CVs with LaTeX

Welcome to my repository showcasing ATS-compliant CVs built using LaTeX in Overleaf. ATS-compliant CVs are crucial for optimizing job applications as they are easily parsed by automated tracking systems used by companies to filter resumes.

## Why ATS-Compliant CVs?
Many companies today use Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to streamline their hiring processes. These systems automatically scan and parse CVs, identifying relevant keywords and qualifications. However, complex formatting and non-standard fonts can prevent these systems from correctly reading your resume. That's where ATS-compliant CVs come inâ€”using a simple, clean format that is compatible with ATS, ensuring your qualifications are not overlooked.

## Why LaTeX?
LaTeX is a powerful typesetting system widely used in academic and professional fields for creating highly structured documents. With LaTeX, you can:
- Create precise and structured CVs.
- Use simple formatting to ensure compatibility with ATS systems.
- Automate the formatting process, allowing for easy updates and changes.

## Features of the ATS CV Template
- Simple, single-column layout with clear section headers.
- Standard fonts like Arial or Times New Roman for parser compatibility.
- Clean design without images, tables, or columns, making it ATS-friendly.
- Easy to modify and update for different job applications.
